## About Me {#about}

![Profile Photo](./images/user.jpg)

Every brand has a story behind it - whether that is one that leaves customers feeling informed and educated, or one that sparks joy and delight. I'm passionate about not only defining and articulating that story, but also developing my mind and myself which companies can utilize to tell that story and maximize their reach.

We're living in an exhilarating time where you can reach millions of people through so many different channels. That being said, to build a brand, you need to identify the right audience and craft the right story.

I'm currently freelancing and I'm open to new opportunities. Please feel free to get in touch with me on pandeykeshwam1122@gmail.com and we can explore how I can help.
